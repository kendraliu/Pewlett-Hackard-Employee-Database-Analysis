# SQL Challenge: Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis

This project involves analyzing employee data from the 1980s to 1990s at Pewlett Hackard. The data is provided in six CSV files. The tasks include data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using SQL. A database design diagram (DBD) is created to better illustrate the database schema and help navigating the database.

## Project Structure
The project repository consists of the following files:
* /Pewlett_Hackard_db.sql: contains table schemas created for the data and the SQL queries used to answer specific questions about the data.
* /Pewlett_Hackard_dbd.png: the DBD of this database.
* /data/: contains the input csv files.
* README.md: The documentation file providing an overview of the project.

## Data Modeling
The Pewlett_Hackard_dbd.png file includes table schemas for the six CSV files. The DBD depicts the relationships between the tables, including primary keys and foreign keys.

## Data Engineering
The Pewlett_Hackard_db.sql file contains the SQL statements used to create the table schema for each CSV file. The statements specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other necessary constraints.

## Data Analysis
The Pewlett_Hackard_db.sql file also includes SQL queries that answer specific questions about the data. The queries retrieve information such as employee details, department information, hiring dates, and more. Each query is documented and labeled with its purpose.
