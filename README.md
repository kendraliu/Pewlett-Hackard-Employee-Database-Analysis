# SQL Challenge: Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis

This project involves analyzing employee data from the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard. The data is provided in six CSV files. The tasks include data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using SQL.

## Project Structure
The project repository consists of the following files:
* data_modeling.sql: Contains the entity relationship diagram (ERD) or table schemas created for the data.
* data_engineering.sql: Contains the SQL statements used to create the tables and import the CSV data.
* data_analysis.sql: Contains the SQL queries used to answer specific questions about the data.
* README.md: The documentation file providing an overview of the project.

## Data Modeling
The data_modeling.sql file includes the entity relationship diagram (ERD) or table schemas for the six CSV files. The ERD depicts the relationships between the tables, including primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

## Data Engineering
The data_engineering.sql file contains the SQL statements used to create the table schema for each CSV file and import the data into the corresponding SQL tables. The statements specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other necessary constraints.

## Data Analysis
The data_analysis.sql file includes SQL queries that answer specific questions about the data. The queries retrieve information such as employee details, department information, hiring dates, and more. Each query is documented and labeled with its purpose.
